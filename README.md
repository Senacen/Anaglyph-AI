# Anaglyph AI
A website that allows a user to upload a monocular image, and converts it to a 3D [Anaglyph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_3D) image to be viewed with red-cyan glasses

### Retinal Rivalry
Retinal rivalry (or (binocular rivalry)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_rivalry]) is a visual phenomenon that occurs when each eye recieves different information, and the brain cannot reconcile them. This causes a "flashing" effect, where briefly, one eye will dominate, and you will see what that eye sees, and then the other will take over, and so on (although if you have a very dominant eye, this may not happen as much). When wearing red-cyan anaglyph glasses, this effect occurs most strongly when viewing a red portion of an image, as the red filter causes the left eye to see a bright portion, while the cyan filter causes the right eye to see a a dark portion. This conflict causes retinal rivalry, and can make viewing images with red in them uncomfortable.
